## Building:
* Navigate to the `src/` directory, and run `npm install`
* Now that dependencies are stored locally, zip `index.js` and `node_modules/`
  together. Make sure these are not hidden in a subdirectory inside the zip, but
  are rather copied to the primary directory when opened.
* The created zip is now fully ready to be deployed to AWS Lambda

## Lambda Deploy:
Instructions coming soon...
